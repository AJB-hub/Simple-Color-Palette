Was reading about how to make some changes to Font in VBA and decided to try my hand at an example exercise: https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/examples/background-colors.html.

Useful to have on hand if you want a quick reference for color options when creating macros in VB for excel.

Looking to find a cleaner way to choose a font color which doesn't rely on conditionals / uses a map which guarentees the font color is legible for a cell.
