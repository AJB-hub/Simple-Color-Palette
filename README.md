<h3>A youtube thought</h3>
    <p>
        After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LLXnUdUIc) on graphic design,
        I noticed the color wheel could be broken into a modular system. Currently looking into how this
        could apply for web design. My aha moment was when the color wheel is shown, I instantly remembered 
        my VBA code which generates a 7x8 Color Palette.

<h3>Complementary System: </h3>
    <p>
         ( n / 2 ) mod n is the complementary system.
    </p> 
<h3>Split-Complements:</h3>
    <p>
        Initial thought was for ( n / 2 ) +- c mod n however I feel this is clearly begging for n to approach infinity
        so the limit as n approaches infinity would be equivalent to the complementary system, meaning any distintion 
        between the two after a certain point is neglegable. Thus I suspect ( n / 2 ) +- n mod n to be an interesting choice.
