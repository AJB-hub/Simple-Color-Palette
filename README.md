<h4>The clock strikes twelve... </h4>

After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LLXnUdUIc) on graphic design,
I noticed the color wheel could be broken into a modular system. Currently looking into how this
could apply for web design. My aha moment was when the color wheel is shown, I instantly remembered 
the VBA code which generates a 7x8 Color Palette. 


<h6>Some initial thoughts for later:                                                                    </h6>

( n / 2 ) mod n is the complementary system


Split-Complements
Initial thought was for ( n / 2 ) +- c mod n however I feel this is clearly begging for n to approach infinity
so the limit as n approaches infinity would be equivalent to the complementary system, meaning any distintion 
between the two after a certain point is neglegable. Thus I suspect ( n / 2 ) +- n mod n to be an interesting choice.
